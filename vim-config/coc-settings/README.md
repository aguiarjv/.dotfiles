# VIM Conquer of Completion (CoC) Plugin Settings

This is the settings file that I use for managing language servers extensions
in the coc plugin.

Using neovim, the settings file is located at **~/.config/nvim/** along with the
init.vim file.

Check the [CoC GitHub Page](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for the
documentation on how to set up properly.

Some of the configurations in the file need to have a package installed beforehand
e.g: jedi and black (for python)
