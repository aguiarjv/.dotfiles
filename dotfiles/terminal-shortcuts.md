# Terminal Shortcuts

Here I'll be showing my personal shortcuts to use on the terminal (commands I should remember).

* **tv-audio** change audio output

* **hs-audio** change audio output

* **esc** vim-mode (after [zsh](https://github.com/aguiarjv/Linux-Configs/tree/main/zsh-config) proper setup)

* **Ctrl+l** clears terminal

* **Ctrl+f** open fzf on my '\~/work' and '\~/personal' folders

* **Ctrl+n** open fzf and then opens file on nvim

* **Ctrl+o** opens ranger

* **Ctrl+T** fzf: paste selected file path to command line

* **Ctrl+R** fzf: paste selected command from history into the command line

* **Alt-C** fzf: cd into the selected directory
