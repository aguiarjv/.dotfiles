# Dotfiles

Here I'll be saving and updating my personal dotfiles, used on my Linux configurations.<br />
On each file should be a description of its use.


### Aliases file

The 'aliases' file contains some configuration that should be added to your '.zshrc' file. This file has the shortcuts
that I use.
