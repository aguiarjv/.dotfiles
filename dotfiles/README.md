# Dotfiles

Here I'll be saving and updating my personal dotfiles, used on my Linux configurations.<br />
On each file should be a description of its use.

## Aliases file

The 'aliases' file contains some shortcuts that I use. This file was moved to the [zsh folder](https://github.com/aguiarjv/Linux-Configs/tree/main/zsh-config)
