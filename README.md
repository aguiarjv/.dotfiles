# Linux-Configs

Here I'll be saving and updating my current linux setup files and info.

### What do I use?

* NVIM

* tmux

* zsh and [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

* To have everything running as it should, install: ripgrep, fzf, nodejs and check the other folders in this repo.
