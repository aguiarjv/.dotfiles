# ZSH Configuration Files

These are my ZSH configuration files based on this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTLYiNvRIVI). <br />
To have everything working properly the files should be placed on the following folder:

````
$HOME/dotfiles/personal/zsh/
````

And the following line should be added to your .zshrc file:

````
source $HOME/dotfiles/personal/zsh/zshrc
````

The plugin 'zsh_autosuggetions' may cause some lagging. <br />
I'm still using "Oh My ZSH" but I plan to use only these configurations once I found them satisfying.
